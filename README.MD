# Tweaky - test your PHP/JS/CSS in localhost, using live HTML and raw previews.

**Tweaky** is a very simple web application, working on a local machine,  where you can quick experiment with PHP and HTML and see its output **live** as HTML. An alternative to using PHP in CLI mode.

## Installation

No dependencies (except of course having PHP already installed), so just download this repo to some location on your local webserver, and then visit it with your browser. Or:

```bash
cd /var/www/html ## just an example
git clone https://github.com/kpion/tweaky.git
```

And then open your browser and visit e.g.  http://localhost/tweaky

## ToDo

 - "Opening" whole directories, i.e. just listing their contents and enabling users to click the files inside to edit them.

 - Maybe add more server side languages, as an option.

 - Add more kitties to the demo, ppl love kitties.

 - Find some research confirming point #3. It sounds a bit silly.
